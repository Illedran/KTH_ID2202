# Research Methodology and Scientific Writing 

This repository contains the assignments of the 2018 edition of the Research Methodology and Scientific Writing course at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.

Done with my group mate @bwhub.

## Course Description

The aim of the course is to give the students the theoretical and practical skills to plan, conduct, analyze and present, orally and in written form, a scientific assignment in the area of information and communication technology and to give insight and understanding of research methodology, ethics and sustainability.

The course is divided into three parts where the parts are integrated in a final project. The three parts are:

 * research methodology
 * scientific writing
 * scientific assignments

These three parts are examined by a project plan, a method description and a scientific report, as well as an opposition report.
